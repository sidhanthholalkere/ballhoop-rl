# Ball in Hoop RL
An open-source benchmark for sim2real reinforcement learning


just a note:
The environment's state is represented as:
th Dth psi Dpsi r Dr phi Dphi mode

Where th = angle of hoop, psi = angle of ball posn, r = dist between ball and hoop, phi = angle of ball, mode = its "meta state"
